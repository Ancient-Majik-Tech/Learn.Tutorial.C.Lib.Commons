## Realms C With Realms Commons Headers Tutorial Packages

This wiki is a collection of three different tutorial packages: [Raw C Tutorials][Sec CTuts], [Realms Primitive C][Sec PrimRealmsC], [Realms C Commons Headers][Sec RealmsCommonHeaders] which together provide a complete understanding of the low level (primitive) coding used by Realms C and Realms C OOP. 

However this will not contain a tutorial package for Realms C OOP as that is contained in the [Realms Tutorial Collections: Realms C OOP Library][Project RealmsCOOP]. 

This is done as the direct tutorials in this package is designed to understand everything available to our project [Realms Core: Primitive][Project RealmsCPrim] which is the true backbone behind Realms C OOP. 

Please note that Realms Tutorial Collections is a **new** and **work in progress** but we welcome you to follow us as we build a better world of the future one step at a time.


### Raw C Tutorials

Welcome to the Tutorial Package **Raw C**, this package is designed to provide the basic understanding of the tools used to build our projects, along with tutorials designed for those new to or interested in learning C programming.

This package is designed to help people answer things like what is a function and other questions relating to some of the basics of the version of the C language that our libraries and works are designed and built with. 

For more Information you can check out the [package home][Page RawCHome] page for more information or to dive in.

### Realms C Tutorials

Welcome to the Tutorial Package **Realms C**, this package is designed to provide understanding how how to use the C language in a way that is compatible with our projects to allow users and our works to all be designed to work along side eachother.

This package is seperated from the [raw c tutorials][Page RawCHome] as working with raw c differes quite alot from how it is used with Realms C. For instance most work directly with the C Standard Library to create objects. While with Realms C, when used correctly alongside [Realms Tutorial Collections: Realms C Primitive Library][Project RealmsCPrim] provides users with basic tools for making works with C and our development of our works much smoother to speend less time debugging.

For more Information you can check out the [package home][Page RealmsCHome] page for more information or to dive in.

### Realms C Common Headers

Welcome to the Tutorial Package **Realms C Common Headers**, this package is designed how to use and the reasons behind providing Realms C Common Headers Library to make the process of addaping works or creating new works that are designed according to Realms C Tutorials.

This package covers the available configuring, what the reasons behind how it is formated along with more that how to correctly use and impliment said features.

For more Information you can check out the [package home][Page RealmsCCommons] page for more information or to dive in.
